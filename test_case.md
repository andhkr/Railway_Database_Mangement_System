Okay, here is a comprehensive Test Plan and corresponding Test Cases for your Flask Railway Management System, focusing on the database aspects (triggers, roles, functions/views) and their interaction with the application layer described by your file structure.

**Test Plan: Railway Management System**

**1. Introduction**

*   **Purpose:** To define the testing strategy, scope, resources, and schedule for testing the Railway Management System. The goal is to verify the functionality, reliability, security, and performance of the system, particularly focusing on database integrity, triggers, stored procedures/functions, role-based access, and core application features.
*   **Scope:**
    *   **In Scope:** Database schema integrity, triggers, functions, views, user roles and permissions, core Flask application functionalities (Authentication, Search, Booking, Cancellation, PNR Status, Role-based Dashboards) based on the provided `tables_indexes.txt`, `triggers_template.txt`, `function_templates.txt`, and Flask project structure.
    *   **Out of Scope:** Comprehensive performance/load testing, advanced security vulnerability testing (beyond basic RBAC), specific browser compatibility testing (unless specified), UI/UX aesthetic testing (focus is on functionality), third-party integrations (e.g., actual payment gateway).

**2. Testing Types**

*   **Unit Testing:** Testing individual database functions (`allot`, `pnr_status`, etc.) and potentially Python functions within `models/database.py` in isolation.
*   **Integration Testing:** Testing the interaction between Flask routes (`app.py`), database query functions (`models/database.py`), and the database itself. Verifying triggers fire correctly upon specific actions initiated via the application.
*   **System Testing:** Testing the end-to-end user flows through the web interface (e.g., Register -> Login -> Search -> Book -> View Ticket -> Cancel).
*   **Security Testing (Basic):** Focusing on Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) â€“ ensuring users/admins/employees can only perform actions permitted by their roles. Testing authentication and session management.
*   **Usability Testing (Basic):** Ensuring the web interface is navigable and core functions are easy to perform. Checking if forms work and feedback is provided to the user.

**3. Test Environment & Setup**

*   **Database:** PostgreSQL instance with the schema defined in `tables_indexes.txt`.
*   **Backend:** Python environment with Flask and all dependencies from `requirements.txt` installed.
*   **Frontend:** Standard web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
*   **Test Data:** A representative set of test data is crucial. This includes:
    *   Multiple Stations, Routes, Trains (with varying capacities/classes).
    *   Fare per KM data.
    *   Seats defined for trains across different classes.
    *   Schedules for trains on different days/times.
    *   User accounts with different roles (Admin, Employee, User).
    *   Employee records, potentially linked to duties.
    *   Existing tickets (confirmed) and waiting list entries.
    *   Passengers.
    *   Password reset tokens (for testing).

**4. Test Areas & Features**

*   **A. Database Integrity & Constraints:** Verify table structures, keys, relationships, and constraints.
*   **B. Database Triggers:** Test the logic of each defined trigger.
*   **C. Database Functions & Views:** Test the inputs, outputs, and logic of each function/view.
*   **D. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Verify permissions granted to `user_role`, `admin_role`, `employee_role`.
*   **E. User Authentication & Registration:** Test Login, Logout, Registration, Password Change/Reset.
*   **F. Train Search Functionality:** Test searching for trains based on criteria.
*   **G. Ticket Booking Process:** Test booking confirmed tickets and adding to the waiting list.
*   **H. Ticket Management:** Test viewing user tickets and cancelling tickets.
*   **I. PNR Status Check:** Test retrieving the status of a ticket/waitlist entry.
*   **J. Admin Functionality:** Test admin-specific views/actions (e.g., `admin_train_overview`).
*   **K. Employee Functionality:** Test employee-specific views/actions (e.g., `employee_duties`).
*   **L. Frontend/Usability:** Basic checks on page rendering, navigation, and form interactions.

**Area D: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

*   **Setup:** Create users: `test_admin` (admin_role), `test_employee` (employee_role), `test_user` (user_role). Grant privileges (examples below - adjust based on actual needs).
    *   `GRANT SELECT ON Stations, Trains TO user_role, employee_role, admin_role;`
    *   `GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON Passengers, Tickets, Waiting_List TO user_role, admin_role;` (Maybe not admin?)
    *   `GRANT DELETE ON Tickets, Waiting_List WHERE ticket_user = current_user_id() TO user_role;` (Conceptual - requires row-level security or application logic)
    *   `GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON Employees, Duties, Schedules TO admin_role;`
    *   `GRANT SELECT ON Schedules, Duties WHERE employee_id = current_employee_id() TO employee_role;` (Conceptual)
    *   `GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION register_user, book_ticket, cancel_ticket, get_user_tickets, pnr_status, search_trains TO user_role;`
    *   `GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION employee_duties TO employee_role;`
    *   `GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCE shared_ticket_id TO user_role, admin_role;`
    *   `GRANT SELECT ON admin_train_overview TO admin_role;`

**7. Reporting**

*   Defects found during testing will be logged using a bug tracking tool or spreadsheet.
*   Each defect report will include: Test Case ID (if applicable), Severity, Priority, Description, Steps to Reproduce, Expected Result, Actual Result, Environment, Screenshots (if helpful).
*   Regular test summary reports will be generated indicating tests passed, failed, blocked, and overall progress.

This plan provides a solid foundation. Remember to adapt it based on the final implementation details of your functions and triggers. Good luck with testing!
